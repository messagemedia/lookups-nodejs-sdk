# Getting started

The MessageMedia Messages API provides a number of endpoints for validating the phone numbers you’re sending to by checking their validity, type and carrier records.

## How to Build

The generated SDK relies on [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (NPM) being available to resolve dependencies. If you don't already have NPM installed, please go ahead and follow instructions to install NPM from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
The SDK also requires Node to be installed. If Node isn't already installed, please install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
> NPM is installed by default when Node is installed

To check if node and npm have been successfully installed, write the following commands in command prompt:

* `node --version`
* `npm -version`

![Version Check](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=versionCheck&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaLookups-Node)

Now use npm to resolve all dependencies by running the following command in the root directory (of the SDK folder):

```bash
npm install
```

![Resolve Dependencies](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=resolveDependency1&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaLookups-Node)

![Resolve Dependencies](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=resolveDependency2)

This will install all dependencies in the `node_modules` folder.

Once dependencies are resolved, you will need to move the folder `MessageMediaLookups ` in to your `node_modules` folder.

## How to Use

The following section explains how to use the library in a new project.

### 1. Open Project Folder
Open an IDE/Text Editor for JavaScript like Sublime Text. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

Click on `File` and select `Open Folder`.

![Open Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=openFolder)

Select the folder of your SDK and click on `Select Folder` to open it up in Sublime Text. The folder will become visible in the bar on the left.

![Open Project](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=openProject&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaLookups-Node)

### 2. Creating a Test File

Now right click on the folder name and select the `New File` option to create a new test file. Save it as `index.js` Now import the generated NodeJS library using the following lines of code:

```js
var lib = require('lib');
```

Save changes.

![Create new file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=createNewFile&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaLookups-Node)

![Save new file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=saveNewFile&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaLookups-Node)

### 3. Running The Test File

To run the `index.js` file, open up the command prompt and navigate to the Path where the SDK folder resides. Type the following command to run the file:

```
node index.js
```

![Run file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=runProject&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaLookups-Node)


## How to Test

These tests use Mocha framework for testing, coupled with Chai for assertions. These dependencies need to be installed for tests to run.
Tests can be run in a number of ways:

### Method 1 (Run all tests)

1. Navigate to the root directory of the SDK folder from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha --recursive` to run all the tests.

### Method 2 (Run all tests)

1. Navigate to the `../test/Controllers/` directory from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha *` to run all the tests.

### Method 3 (Run specific controller's tests)

1. Navigate to the `../test/Controllers/` directory from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha  LookupsController`  to run all the tests in that controller file.

> To increase mocha's default timeout, you can change the `TEST_TIMEOUT` parameter's value in `TestBootstrap.js`.

## Initialization

### Authentication
In order to setup authentication in the API client, you need the following information.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| basicAuthUserName | The username to use with basic authentication |
| basicAuthPassword | The password to use with basic authentication |



API client can be initialized as following:

```JavaScript
const lib = require('lib');

// Configuration parameters and credentials
lib.Configuration.basicAuthUserName = "basicAuthUserName"; // The username to use with basic authentication
lib.Configuration.basicAuthPassword = "basicAuthPassword"; // The password to use with basic authentication

```

* [LookupsController](#lookups_controller)

## <a name="lookups_controller"></a>![Class: ](https://apidocs.io/img/class.png ".LookupsController") LookupsController

### Get singleton instance

The singleton instance of the ``` LookupsController ``` class can be accessed from the API Client.

```javascript
var controller = lib.LookupsController;
```

### <a name="get_lookup_a_phone_number"></a>![Method: ](https://apidocs.io/img/method.png ".LookupsController.getLookupAPhoneNumber") getLookupAPhoneNumber

> Use the Lookups API to find information about a phone number.
> A request to the lookups API has the following format:
> ```/v1/lookups/phone/{phone_number}?options={carrier,type}```
> The `{phone_number}` parameter is a required field and should be set to the phone number to be looked up.
> The options query parameter can also be used to request additional information about the phone number.
> By default, a request will only return the `country_code` and `phone_number` properties in the response.
> To request details about the the carrier, include `carrier` as a value of the options parameter.
> To request details about the type, include `type` as a value of the options parameter. To pass multiple values
> to the options parameter, use a comma separated list, i.e. `carrier,type`.
> A successful request to the lookups endpoint will return a response body as follows:
> ```json
> {
>   "country_code": "AU",
>   "phone_number": "+61491570156",
>   "type": "mobile",
>   "carrier": {
>     "name": "Telstra"
>   }
> }
> ```
> Each property in the response body is defined as follows:
> - ```country_code``` ISO ALPHA 2 country code of the phone number
> - ```phone_number``` E.164 formatted phone number
> - ```type``` The type of number. This can be ```"mobile"``` or ```"landline"```
> - ```carrier``` Holds information about the specific carrier (if available)
>   - ```name``` The carrier's name as reported by the network


```javascript
function getLookupAPhoneNumber(phoneNumber, options, callback)
```
